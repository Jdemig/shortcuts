# React Native Notes


## Misc (To be Categorized)

* All dimensions in React Native are unitless, and represent density-independent
  pixels.
* Flexbox works the same way in React Native as it does in CSS on the web, with a
  few exceptions.  The defaults are different, with `flexDirection` defaulting to
  `column` instead of `row`, and the `flex` parameter only supporting a single
  number.

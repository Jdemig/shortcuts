## From Lynda.com's Amazon Web Services Essential Training

**The Cloud**

Generally refers to anything involving hosted services over the internet.
These hosted services are often broken into three main categories:
Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS, Platform as a Service, or PaaS, and
Software as a Service, or SaaS.  The differences between these lies in the
level of abstraction or virtualization being provided.

### Business Benefits

* Just-in-time infrastructure.
* No long-term contracts.

### Technical Benefits

* Scriptable infrastructure.
* Scalability.
* Improved development lifecycle:
  - Production can be cloned for test and development environment.
* High availability.
* Disaster recovery.

### Scaling

**Scaling Out**

Aka horizontal scaling, is when capacity is added to a system by adding more
components or nodes that make up that system.

**Scaling In**

Aka horizontal scaling, is when capacity is removed from a system by
decreasing the number of components or nodes.

**Scaling Up**

Aka vertical scaling, is when resources are added to a single component or
node in the system in order to increase its capacity to handle load.

**Scaling Down**

Aka vertical scaling, is reducing the resources of a single component or node
in the system.

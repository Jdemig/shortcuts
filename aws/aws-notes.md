**The Cloud**

Generally refers to anything involving hosted services over the internet.
These hosted services are often broken into three main categories:
Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS, Platform as a Service, or PaaS, and
Software as a Service, or SaaS.  The differences between these lies in the
level of abstraction or virtualization being provided.

### Business Benefits

* Minimum upfront investment.
* Just-in-time infrastructure.
* No long-term contracts.

# WordPress Installation Notes

See https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-with-lemp-on-ubuntu-16-04
for how to install WordPress on Ubuntu 16.04 alongside LEMP.

## Web Interface Configuration

After installing WordPress and first navigating to your domain, you will be prompted to
finish installation of WordPress.  Here are the steps I took.

1) Pick a language.
2) Enter a Site Title.
3) Enter a Username.
4) Enter a Password.
5) Enter your email.
6) Choose whether to discourage search engines from indexing the site.
7) Click Install WordPress.

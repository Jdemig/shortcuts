# Relay Notes

Relay is a JavaScript framework for building data-driven React applications.


## Features

* Declarative: Declare the data your components need with GraphQL, Relay
  determines how and when to fetch your data.

* Colocation: GraphQL is written next to the views that rely on them.  Relay
  aggregates queries into efficient network requests.

* Mutations: Write GraphQL mutations and Relay offers automatic data
  consistency, optimistic updates, and error handling.

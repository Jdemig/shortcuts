# Architecture Cheat Sheet

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture for details.

Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system, the discipline of creating such
structures, and the documentation of these structures.  These structures are needed to reason about the software
system.  Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and
relations, along with rationale for the introduction and configuration of each element.

Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices which are costly to change once implemented. 


## Architecture Styles/Patterns

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern for details.

An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture
within a given context.  Architectural patterns are similar to software design pattern but have a broader scope.  The
architectural patterns address various issues in software engineering, such as computer hardware performance
limitations, high availability and minimization of a business risk.

> Architectural styles are reusable 'packages' of design decisions and constraints that are applied to an architecture
> to induce chosen desirable qualities.

> An architectural style defines: a family of systems in terms of a pattern of structural organization; a vocabulary
> of components and connectors, with constraints on how they can be combined.

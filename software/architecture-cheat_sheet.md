# Architecture Cheat Sheet

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture for details.

Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system, the discipline of creating such
structures, and the documentation of these structures.  These structures are needed to reason about the software
system.  Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and
relations, along with rationale for the introduction and configuration of each element.

Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices which are costly to change once implemented.

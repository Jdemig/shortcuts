# Java Cheat Sheet


## New in Java 8

See http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8-whats-new-2157071.html and
https://leanpub.com/whatsnewinjava8/read for details.

### Summary

* Lambda expressions
* Method references
* Default Methods (Defender methods)
* Improved type inference
* ethod parameter reflection
* A new Stream API
* A new Date/Time API
* Concurrency improvements
* Nashorn, the new JavaScript engine
* Removal of the Permanent Generation

### Java Programming Language

**Lambda Expressions**

A lambda expression is like syntactic sugar for an anonymous class with one method whose type is inferred.

* Enable you to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data.
* Let you express instances of single-method interfaces (referred to as functional interfaces) more compactly.

### Collections

Classes in the new `java.util.stream` package provide a Stream API to support functional-style operations on streams
of elements.  The Stream API is integrated into the Collections API, which enables bulk operations on collections,
such as sequential or parallel map-reduce transformations.

### Compact Profiles

Java 8 contains predefined subsets of the Java SE platform and enable applications that do not require the entire
Platform to be deployed and run on small devices.

### Security

WIP

### Scripting

The Rhino javascript engine has been replaced with the Nashorn Javascript Engine

This means that the next time youâ€™re looking to integrate JS into your backend, instead of setting up a node.js
instance, you can simply use the JVM to execute the code.  The added bonus here is the ability to have seamless
interoperability between your Java and JavaScript code in-process, without having to use various IPC/RPC methods to
bridge the gap.

## Tools

* The jjs command is provided to invoke the Nashorn engine.

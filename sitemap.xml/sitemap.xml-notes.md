# sitemap.xml Notes

The Sitemaps protocol allows a webmaster to inform search engines about URLs on
a website that are available for crawling.  A Sitemap is an XML file that lists
the URLs for a site.  It allows webmasters to include additional information
about each URL:

* When it was last updated
* How often it changes
* How important it is in relation to other URLs in the site

This allows search engines to crawl the site more intelligently. 


## File Format

The Sitemap Protocol format consists of XML tags.  The file itself must be UTF-8
encoded.  They may be gzipped compressed.

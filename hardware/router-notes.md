# Router Notes


## LinkSys

Note: The following information is for a LinkSys E2500, but most of it is
probably applicable to other LinkSys routers too.

**Default Username/Password**

Un: admin
Pw: admin

### IP Reservation

From the `Setup` > `Basic Setup screen`, there is a DHCP Reservation button
about half way down.  Clicking this button will open the DHCP Reservation
dialog.

### Port Forwarding

Port forwarding can be configured under `Applications & Gaming`.  Before
configuring, it would be wise to reserve the IP for the device you plan to
configure for port forwarding.

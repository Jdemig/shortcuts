# Web Development UI Notes


## Common Data Table Patterns

* For columns with data that does not vary much in width, hardcoding a width is
  common.  A classic example is for date columns.  These can usually be hardcode
  to a width that is just wide enough to display the date without truncation plus
  a little bit more to account for browsers displaying the same data at slightly
  different widths.


## Often Forgotten Styles

* Focus
  - Sometimes the choosen style may not work well with some components.  For
    example, may be hard to see that a button is focused depending on the background
    color of the button.
* Text Selection

# Markdown Cheat Sheet

See https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ for details.

See [Github Flavored Markdown][gfm] for some extensions/changes to the
original markdown syntax.

## Conventions

Here is a list of some of the conventions I use in my markdown to help provide
consistency.

**Bullet Lists**

Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (*, +, and -) as
list markers.  These three markers are interchangable.  They can be nested 
too.

Because they can be nested, I use `*` at the top-level, followed by `+`,
followed by `-`, and then repeat beginning with `*`.

* (`*`) Asterisk at top-level
  + (`+`) Plus at second-level
    - (`-`) Minus at third-level
      * (`*`) Asterisk at fourth-level
        + (`+`) Plus at fifth-level
          - (`-`) Minus at sixth-level

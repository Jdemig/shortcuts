# YAML Notes

“YAML Ain’t Markup Language” (abbreviated YAML) is a data serialization
language designed to be human-friendly.  YAML was specifically created to work
well for common use cases such as: configuration files, log files,
interprocess messaging, cross-language data sharing, object persistence, and
debugging of complex data structures.

# YAML Notes

“YAML Ain’t Markup Language” (abbreviated YAML) is a data serialization
language designed to be human-friendly.  YAML was specifically created to work
well for common use cases such as: configuration files, log files,
interprocess messaging, cross-language data sharing, object persistence, and
debugging of complex data structures.


## Goals

The design goals for YAML are, in decreasing priority:

* YAML is easily readable by humans.
* YAML data is portable between programming languages.
* YAML matches the native data structures of agile languages.
* YAML has a consistent model to support generic tools.
* YAML supports one-pass processing.
* YAML is expressive and extensible.
* YAML is easy to implement and use.

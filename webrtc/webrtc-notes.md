# WebRTC Notes

From [Wikipedia][]

> WebRTC ("Web Real-Time Communication") is a collection of communications
> protocols and APIs that enable real-time communication over peer-to-peer
> connections.  This allows web browsers to not only request resources from
> backend servers, but also real-time information from browsers of other users.

From [MDN][]

> WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications) is a technology which enables Web
> applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video
> media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without
> requiring an intermediary.  The set of standards that comprises WebRTC makes
> it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer, without
> requiring that the user to install plug-ins or any other third-party software.
> 
> WebRTC consists of several interrelated APIs and protocols which work together
> to achieve this.

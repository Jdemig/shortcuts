# SharePoint Cheat Sheet

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SharePoint for details.

SharePoint is a web based application that integrates with Microsoft Office.  SharePoint is primarily sold as a
document management and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and usage varies substantially between
organizations.

SharePoint is installed on a server.  Then a web browser on a desktop, tablet, or phone is used to connect to the
server.

Different people work with different aspects of SharePoint, so for some of us, SharePoint is a collaboration site.  For
others of us, SharePoint is simply a place to store documents.  For some of us, SharePoint is a workflow engine that's
used to automate tasks that we do on a everyday basis.  But SharePoint is more than any of those individual things.
That is, SharePoint is a platform that organizations use to build solutions for a wide variety of business problems.

Allows collaboration with Outlook, Word, Visio, and other products.

## Editions

SharePoint comes in various editions:

### SharePoint Server

SharePoint Server is provided to organizations that seek greater control over SharePoint's behavior or design.  This
product is installed on the customer's IT infrastructure.  It receives less frequent updates, but has access to a wider
set of features and customization capabilities.  There are three editions of SharePoint Server: Standard, Enterprise,
and Foundation (free) which was discontinued in 2016.

### SharePoint Standard

SharePoint Standard builds on the SharePoint Foundation in a few key product areas.

* **Sites**: Audience targeting, governance tools, Secure store service, web analytics functionality.
* **Communities**: 'MySites' (personal profiles including skills management, and search tools), enterprise wikis,
  organization hierarchy browser, tags, and notes.
* **Content**: Improved tooling and compliance for document & record management, managed metadata, word automation
  services, content type management.
* **Search**: Better search results, search customization abilities, mobile search, 'Did you mean?', OS search
  integration, Faceted Search, and metadata/relevancy/date/location-based refinement options.
* **Composites**: Pre-built workflow templates, BCS profile pages.

SharePoint Standard licensing includes a CAL (client access license) component and a server fee.  SharePoint Standard
may also be licensed through a cloud model.

### SharePoint Enterprise

Built upon SharePoint Standard, SharePoint Enterprise features can be unlocked simply by providing an additional
license key.

Extra features in SharePoint Enterprise includes:

* Search thumbnails and previews, rich web indexing, better search results.
* Business intelligence integration, dashboards, and business data surfacing.
* PowerPivot and PerformancePoint.

SharePoint Enterprise licensing includes a CAL component and a server fee that must be purchased in addition to
SharePoint Server licensing.  SharePoint Enterprise may also be licensed through a cloud model.

### SharePoint Online

Microsoft's hosted SharePoint is typically bundled in Microsoft Office 365 subscriptions, but can be purchased
outright.  It is limited to a core set of collaboration, file hosting, and document and content management scenarios,
and is updated on a frequent basis, but is typically comparable with SharePoint Enterprise.  Currently, additional

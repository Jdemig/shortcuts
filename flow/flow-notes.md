# Flow Notes

See https://flow.org/ for details.

Flow is a static type checker for JavaScript.

Flow checks your code for errors through static type annotations.  These types
allow you to tell Flow how you want your code to work, and Flow will make sure
it does work that way.

Using data flow analysis, Flow infers types and tracks data as it moves
through your code.  You don't need to fully annotate your code before Flow can
start to find bugs.

# Fullscreen Notes

From [MDN]:

> The Fullscreen API provides an easy way for web content to be presented using
> the user's entire screen.  The API lets you easily direct the browser to make
> an element and its children, if any, occupy the fullscreen, eliminating all
> browser user interface and other applications from the screen for the
> duration.

**Prefixing**

As of this writing (2017-10-04), all browsers supporting fullscreen use a
prefixed API.  See [MDN][mdn-prefix] for details.

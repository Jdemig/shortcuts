# Google AdSense Notes

AdSense is a free, simple way to make money online by placing ads on your
website.  Advertisers bid for your ad space in a real-time auction.


## More Ways to Make Money

* Custom Search: Allows ads to be based on searches perform on your site.
* Game Sites: Show video, display, or test ads within your own web-based games.
* Video Content: Integrate in-stream and overlay ads with your video content.


## Ad Types

* **Text**: A text ad typically includes a title that's also a clickable link to
  a webpage, one or two lines of text, and a website address shown in green.
  Text ads are sometimes known as "sponsored links" because the title links to
  the advertised website.  These ads can appear on Google search results pages
  and across the Google Display Network.  Text ads might look slightly different
  on the Display Network.
* **Display**: Display ads are graphical ads offered in several ad formats.
* **Rich Media**: A group of interactive ad types that includes HTML, Flash, and
  video ads.  You can choose whether you'd like to display rich media ads when
  creating or editing an ad unit and also set default ad type preferences for
  your account.
* **Link Units**: A link unit displays a list of topics relevant to the content
  of your site, and when users click on one of these topics, they're brought to
  a page of Google ads related to that topic.  Though you won't receive earnings
  for clicks on the topics, you'll be paid for user clicks on any of the ads on
  the resulting page.

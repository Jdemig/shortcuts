# JavaScript Promises Notes

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an
asynchronous operation.  A promise may be created using its constructor.
However, most people are consumers of already-created promises returned from
functions.  Essentially, a promise is a returned object you attach callbacks
to, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises
and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
for details.

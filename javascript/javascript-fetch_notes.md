# JavaScript Fetch API Notes

The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across
the network).

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API for details.

Fetch provides a generic definition of [Request] and [Response] objects (and
other things involved with network requests).
